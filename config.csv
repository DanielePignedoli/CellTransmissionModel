#variable and value are names of columns, do not change them
#distances are expressed in kilometers, times in hours (excet for "mean time gap" which is in seconds); dt, and, simulation time, could be left empty, since they also have defalut values dt = (1/600), source and sink are fraction of the max flow. insert a value in [0,1]
